About this project
--------------
ðŸš€ Simple list of APODs with + Sorting by date / title + add to favorite.

ðŸ›  Simple implementation for MVI architecture pattern and Clean Architecture.

ðŸ›  Unit tests included.

ðŸ›  SOLID principles.

ðŸ›  Standard Coding Style.


Architecture pattern Used
--------------

[MVI][1]


Libraries & Tools Used
--------------

* [Foundation][4] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and unit testing.
* [Test][5] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [View Binding][11] - To more easily write code that interacts with views.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [Navigation][13] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [ViewModel][14] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
    asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [Repository][15] - A Module that handle data operations, You can consider repositories to be mediators between different data sources.
  * [Retrofit][16] - A simple library that is used for network transaction.
  * [Hilt][17]: For [dependency injection][18]
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][19] For managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
  * [Kotlin Flows][20] - A stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
  * [Glide][21] - For image loading.

* Other tools/plugins
  * [Obfuscation, Code shrinking][30] - Obfuscation is to reduce your app size by shortening the names of the appâ€™s classes, methods, and fields. Shrinking to make the app as small as possible.
  * [SonarLint plugin][31] - Static Code Analysis that identifies and helps you fix quality and security issues as you code.

Technical choices
--------------

**MVI vs MVVM**

- A consistent state during the lifecycle of Views.
- As it is unidirectional, Data flow can be tracked and predicted easily.
- It ensures thread safety as the state objects are immutable.
- Easy to debug, As we know the state of the object when the error occurred.
- It's more decoupled as each component fulfills its own responsibility.
- Testing the app also will be easier as we can map the business logic for each state.

**Hilt vs Koin**

- Hilt is built on top of the Dagger, and it comes with some advantages like simplify Dagger code and create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup.
- Hilt generate the code in the compile time, while koin in runtime.

**Coroutines vs RxJava**

- Coroutines come with many advantages over RxJava, beside that it is Kotlin-friendly design pattern, it is:
  * Lightweight: You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension.
  * Fewer memory leaks: Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
  * Built-in cancellation support.
  * Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support.


What's next
--------------
While the project scale up, Some points should be considered:
- Pagination should be handled in all lists from backend and client side.
- More Unit & UI testing functions need to be added.
- Analytics and tracking system should be implemented to provide insight on app usage and user engagement.



Other Projects
--------------

* [Recorder][51] - Another MVVM Sample.
* [Prayer Now][52] - One of the projects I developed has 15+ Million downloads.
* [Mn Ahyaha][53] - Side project I developed from scratch.
